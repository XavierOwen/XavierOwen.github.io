excerpt: 'This paper introduces an active learning framework for manifold Gaussian Process regression, combining manifold learning with strategic data selection to improve prediction accuracy in high-dimensional spaces. The method jointly optimizes a neural network for dimensionality reduction and a Gaussian process regressor in the latent space, guided by an active learning criterion to minimize global error. Experiments show superior performance over random learning, and the approach efficiently handles complex, discontinuous functions while remaining computationally tractable.'

This paper introduces an active learning framework for manifold Gaussian Process (GP) regression, combining manifold learning with strategic data selection to improve accuracy in high-dimensional spaces. Our method jointly optimizes a neural network for dimensionality reduction and a Gaussian process regressor in the latent space, supervised by an active learning criterion that minimizes global prediction error. Experiments on synthetic data demonstrate superior performance over randomly sequential learning. The framework efficiently handles complex, discontinuous functions while preserving computational tractability, offering practical value for scientific and engineering applications. Future work will focus on scalability and uncertainty-aware manifold learning.
