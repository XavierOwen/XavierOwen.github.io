## Lyrics with new translation

There comes a time when we heed a certain call

时候到了，心中有一声呼唤

When the world must come together as one

每个人，被迫，同心来合一

There are people dying

天近哭声远

Oh, when it's time to lend a hand

哦，爱人莫等闲

to life, The greatest gift of all

生命就是最好礼物

---

We can't go on, pretending day by day

梦灯长明，却照不见世上人

That someone, somewhere will soon make a change

算了吧，圣人自会入地狱

We're all a part of, God's great big family

四海皆兄弟，举目却无亲

And the truth, you know

你的心，那光

Love is all we need

所需唯有爱

---

We are the world, we are the children

一即一切，一切即一

We are the ones who make a brighter day, so let’s start giving

一同创造美好明天，从心走这路

There’s a choice we’re making, we’re saving our own lives

舍身是为众生，救我性命如灯

It’s true, we’ll make a better day, just you and me

信我：明天因你和我，而光明

---

Well, send them your heart so they'll know that someone cares

哦，倾心照人，好叫灵魂不孤单

And their lives, will be stronger and free

新生命，如鹰，展翅高飞

As God has shown us by turning stone to bread

石头成了饼，祂也柔软我心（神能从石头中给亚伯拉罕兴起子孙来）

And so we all must lend a helping hand

万人一念，起身，传爱在人间

---

We are the world, we are the children

一即一切，一切即一

We are the ones who make a brighter day, so let’s start giving

一同创造美好明天，从心走这路

There’s a choice we’re making, we’re saving our own lives

舍身是为众生，救我性命如灯

It’s true, we’ll make a better day, just you and me

信我：明天因你和我，而光明

---

When you're down and out

心落起尘埃

And there seems no hope at all

明镜台前雾重重

But if you just believe

一念若有信

There's no way we can fall

万众齐心不再坠

Well, well, well

喔喔喔！

Let's realize, oh, that a change can only come

一同觉悟吧，此身即是众生

When we stand together as one

众心一处，道自来

---

重复

We are the world, we are the children

一即一切，一切即一

We are the ones who make a brighter day, so let’s start giving

一同创造美好明天，从心开始走这路

There’s a choice we’re making, we’re saving our own lives

舍身是为众生，救我性命如灯

It’s true, we’ll make a better day, just you and me

信我：明天因你和我，而光明
